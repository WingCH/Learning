# Progress: JSON Compare App

## What Works

*   Core JSON structure comparison functionality.
*   UI for inputting Base and Actual JSON.
*   Display of comparison results (Missing Fields, New Fields, Type Mismatches).
*   Error handling for invalid JSON input.
*   **Persistence of Base and Actual JSON input fields across page refreshes using `localStorage`.**

## What's Left to Build (Current Scope)

*   No outstanding items related to the persistence feature request.

## Current Status

*   The requested feature to persist JSON input using `localStorage` has been implemented in `src/app/page.tsx`.
*   Memory Bank documentation has been created and updated to reflect this change.

## Known Issues

*   None identified related to the persistence feature.
*   `localStorage` has size limits (typically 5-10MB) which could be exceeded with extremely large JSON inputs, though this is unlikely for typical use cases.
*   Persistence is client-side only; data is not saved on a server.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial focus was solely on comparison logic.
*   User requested input persistence, leading to the implementation using `localStorage` and `useEffect` hooks.
